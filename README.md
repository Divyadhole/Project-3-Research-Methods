# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression. The analysis aims to identify key factors influencing survival rates and build a predictive model based on various passenger attributes.

## Contents
- **Abstract**: Summary of the report and key findings.
- **1. Introduction**: Background information about the Titanic and the analysis objectives.
- **2. Dataset**: Description of the Titanic dataset and features used in the analysis.
- **3. Methodology**: Overview of data preparation, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation metrics.
- **4. Implementation**: Code snippets for loading data, preprocessing, training the model, and evaluating its performance.
- **5. Results and Discussion**: Evaluation results and discussion of model performance and insights gained.
- **6. Conclusion**: Summary of findings and suggestions for future work.

## Requirements
To run the code and reproduce the analysis, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib (for visualizations)

You can install these using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy matplotlib
```

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset used for this analysis is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). Ensure the dataset is saved as `titanic.csv` in a `data` directory.

## Usage
1. Download the Titanic dataset and save it in the `data` directory.
2. Run the code in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, VSCode).
3. Review the results and visualizations.

## Future Work
Potential future improvements include exploring advanced machine learning models and conducting a more in-depth analysis of feature importance.
